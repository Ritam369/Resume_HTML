## Getting Started

### Viewing the Resume

To view the resume locally, open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

### Development

For an enhanced development experience, you can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code. This enables automatic browser refresh upon saving changes, without disturbing the user in development workflow.

## Customization

The resume content can be customized by directly editing the `index.html` file. Simply modify the HTML markup to update personal information, skills, experience, and other sections as needed.
